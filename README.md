## "Plain English" Instructions

Show a line of "film" with old still images of a galloping horse in sequential order against a black background with the words "Ceci n'est pas une animation" under it in a yellowish rounded cursive font to poke fun at my own response to the prompt through a silly visual art history joke.

## Full Notes Prior to Coding

_copied from Note file:_

The instructions say to make a static image, not an animated one. But all animations/film started as static images. I want to DEFY the notion of a difference by coding the single images of the horse racing film (the original / first filmed sequence I think?) as a single line across the screen. 

At first I wanted to put "defy" under it too, but honestly I think it would just be a whole lot funnier if it said "this is not an animation" under it in French 

omg it works even better, the French for 'animation' is apparently just 'animation' 

Ceci n'est pas une animation

So instructions in plain English are: 

Show a line of "film" with old still images of a galloping horse in sequential order against a black background with the words "Ceci n'est pas une animation" under it in a yellowish rounded cursive font to poke fun at my own response to the prompt through a silly visual art history joke.

(omg, "plain English" and PART OF IT'S IN FRENCH) 

(omg what if I title the assignment "The Treachery of Coding") 

(it's only treachery if I do something sneaky I'M GONNA PUT SOURCE/CREDIT LINKS IN THE HTML PART OF THE P5 LOLOLOLOL) 

It's not quite, but Google "Parisienne" font is close
